# OCR and Document Understanding 

## Document OCR processor

The Document OCR (Optical Character Recognition) processor, powered by our latest OCR model mistral-ocr-latest, enables you to extract text and structured content from PDF documents.

## Key features:

- Extracts text content while maintaining document structure and hierarchy
- Preserves formatting like headers, paragraphs, lists and tables
- Returns results in markdown format for easy parsing and rendering
- Handles complex layouts including multi-column text and mixed content
- Processes documents at scale with high accuracy
- Supports multiple document formats including PDF, images, and uploaded documents

The OCR processor returns both the extracted text content and metadata about the document structure, making it easy to work with the recognized content programmatically.
